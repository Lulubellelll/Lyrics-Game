- Some song lyrics from Genius are empty because there is no match. Write a handling for these. (No lyrics available at Genius for this song or lyrics is not available at Genius answer is: {song name} etc.)
- Some song names are like "xxx - remastered", "xxx (remastered)". Because of that Genius returns empty values. Write a hangling for these.
- I couldn't find what to write PROXY_URL in .enc.local . So I get it direct from the main developer.

Considerations:
- Using multiple lyrics database can be conceivable. So even some lyrics are not in Genius, can be get from another database.
